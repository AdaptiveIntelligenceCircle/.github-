### *Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC) – Foundation Readiness Document*

*(Draft for Linux Foundation / CNCF / OpenAI Ecosystem / AI Infrastructure Projects)*

---

## **1. Project Overview**

Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC) is an open-source infrastructure project that aims to define a new class of **self-adaptive, self-protective, and context-aware AI systems**.
AIC introduces an **Adaptive Intelligence Kernel (AIK)** capable of:

* Distributed introspective reasoning
* Behavior simulation
* Human-aligned decision modeling
* Trust-based self-defense
* Modular plugin-based extensions (C++ / Lua / Rust)
* Real-time anomaly detection → rollback pipeline
* Multi-node coordination toward a future “Adaptive Intelligence Network (AIN)”

AIC is designed to operate across heterogeneous environments (devices, servers, edge nodes), making it suitable for **AI infrastructure, autonomous systems, safety-critical applications, and next-generation OS/AI architecture research.**

The project is currently led by:
**Nguyễn Đức Trí – Founder / Lead Architect**

---

## **2. Mission Alignment with the Linux Foundation**

AIC aligns strongly with the Linux Foundation’s mission in three key areas:

### **2.1. Open Governance**

AIC is built from the ground up with community governance:

* Transparent decision-making
* Modular architecture
* Open plugin interfaces
* Contributor-first model
* Open documentation and reproducible builds

These match LF principles for shared governance and decentralization.

### **2.2. Open Source Infrastructure**

AIC’s core is a **systems-level AI infrastructure**, very similar to:

* Kubernetes (CNCF) → orchestration at scale
* ROS 2 (Open Robotics → LF) → distributed behavior modeling
* OpenSSF projects → secure computing foundations

AIC proposes to contribute an entirely new domain:
**Adaptive Intelligence Infrastructure**, complementary to existing LF ecosystem projects.

### **2.3. AI Safety and Ethics**

AIC integrates:

* Human-in-the-Loop simulation
* Contextual reasoning
* Adaptive safeguards
* Trust-based self-defense (non-malicious resilience)

These directly align with:

* LF AI & Data Foundation goals
* OpenSSF secure-by-default standards
* Open Source principles for transparent AI development

AIC aims to become a **neutral, open, and globally collaborative platform** for building trustworthy adaptive AI.

## **3. Technical Scope**

### **3.1. Architectural Domains**

AIC consists of five primary domains:

1. **Core Kernel**

   * Context engine
   * State model
   * Behavior engine
   * Event pipeline
   * Security primitives

2. **Simulation Layer**

   * Behavior sandbox
   * Introspection engine
   * Scenario reasoning
   * Multi-level decision tracing

3. **Modules (Plugins)**

   * Written in C++ / Lua / Rust
   * Analytics
   * Communication
   * Sensor integration
   * Protection (intrusion detection + self-defense)
   * Preprocessing (data cleaner + feature extractor)

4. **Runtime**

   * Memory subsystem
   * Execution engine
   * Reaction loop
   * Distributed backend

5. **AIN (future extension)**

   * Multi-node orchestration
   * Cross-domain adaptive intelligence
   * Edge-to-cloud federated learning
   * Governance protocols for adaptation

---

## **4. Licensing and IP Strategy**

AIC follows an **open-source, open-governance, open-innovation** model.

### **4.1. Current License**

* **GNU GPL-v3.0** (Primary)**
* **Optional Apache 2.0 components** (for derivative modules)

### **4.2. Patent Strategy**

AIC does **not rely on proprietary patents**.
The goal is to become:

* A standards contributor
* A foundation-level open platform

Any future IP will follow:

* Patent Non-Assertion
* Community Patent Pledge
* Neutral governance under LF-style structure

AIC does **not require national patents (Vietnam) or WIPO** before joining LF.

---

## **5. Governance Structure**

### **5.1. Current Maintainer**

* **Lead Maintainer**: Nguyễn Đức Trí
* Project managed via GitHub with transparent commits, issues, and reviews.

### **5.2. Proposed LF Governance (after onboarding)**

* **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**
* **Core Maintainers** for kernel, runtime, simulation, modules
* **Working Groups** for:

  * AI Safety
  * Distributed Intelligence
  * Behavior Modeling
  * Simulation Framework
  * Security

### **5.3. Code of Conduct**

AIC follows Contributor Covenant v2.1.

### **5.4. Contributor Model**

AIC supports:

* DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)
* CLA (Contributor License Agreement)
* Open backlog and roadmap

---

## **6. Community & Adoption Strategy**

### **6.1. Current Community**

AIC is in its early stage and currently maintained by the founder.
However, the architecture has been designed from day one for **global collaboration**.

### **6.2. Short-Term Plan (0–3 months)**

* Public podcast release on Reddit/YouTube
* Release technical articles and whitepapers
* Publish architecture diagrams
* Start the first contributor onboarding
* Provide example datasets & pipelines

### **6.3. Medium-Term Plan (3–12 months)**

* AIN Alpha network
* Developer tools
* Collaborative research with universities and labs
* First LF-based governance meeting

### **6.4. Long-Term Vision**

To evolve from AIC → **AIN (Adaptive Intelligence Network)**:

* A distributed, cross-domain AI infrastructure
* Neutral, open, secure
* Built by community
* Independent of geopolitical or corporate boundaries

The ultimate vision aligns closely with Linux Foundation’s purpose:
**“Enable innovation through open collaboration.”**

## **7. Why AIC Should Join the Linux Foundation**

AIC brings:

* A new class of infrastructure (adaptive intelligence kernel)
* High-security, safety-critical reasoning models
* Modular plugins similar to Linux, ROS, and Kubernetes ecosystems
* Deep commitment to open-source ethics
* Strong alignment with AI/OS/Infrastructure communities

By joining LF, the project gains:

* Neutral legal home
* Trademark protection
* Community governance
* Global visibility
* Access to experts in AI, OS, and security domains

And LF gains:

* A new frontier of adaptive AI research
* A foundation to standardize future AI-OS interop
* A global community of contributors working on next-generation intelligence systems

---

# **Conclusion**

AIC is fully aligned with Linux Foundation’s mission in open governance, infrastructure, security, and collaborative community building. The project is ready to begin the LF onboarding process and contribute to the global open-source ecosystem.
