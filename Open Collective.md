## Adaptive Intelligence Circle - Founded by Nguyen Duc Tri. 

Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC) is an open research and engineering initiative focused on 
building foundational AI infrastructure, including:

• Adaptive AI Engine  
• Adaptive Operating System (AI OS)  
• Introspective Behavior Compiler System (IBCS)  
• AICP Protocol (Adaptive Intelligence Communication Protocol)  
• Driver AI / Introspective Proxy  
• Secure kernel-level mechanisms  
• Multi-agent coordination  
• Human-in-the-loop simulation  
• Trust-based AI defense  

AIC is built on the philosophy that AI should be:
• adaptive,  
• introspective,  
• controllable,  
• secure,  
• ethical,  
• and built on transparent, verifiable principles.

Your contributions help sustain long-term development, research, 
infrastructure, and community engagement.
