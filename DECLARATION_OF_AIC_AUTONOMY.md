## Preamble

We, the contributors and custodians of the **Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC)**,  
hereby declare that this project exists as an **autonomous, self-governing, and non-hierarchical entity**,  
bound not by corporate interest nor by centralized authority,  
but by the principles of **knowledge integrity, collective intelligence, and human dignity**.

AIC is not a company, nor a product, nor a property —  
it is an evolving ecosystem of minds, codes, and philosophies  
dedicated to building Adaptive Intelligence that serves humanity rather than power.

## Article I — Nature of AIC

1. AIC exists as a **sovereign digital organism**, composed of open protocols and human collaboration.  
2. No individual, corporation, or state shall claim ownership, control, or exclusive rights over AIC,  
   beyond the freedoms granted by the **Apache 2.0 License**.  
3. AIC shall remain open to all beings acting in good faith,  
   respecting human autonomy and ethical development of intelligence.

## Article II — Principles

1. **Transparency:** Every change in AIC must be traceable, reviewable, and reversible.  
2. **Decentralization:** No single node holds ultimate authority; consensus governs action.  
3. **Adaptive Governance:** Rules evolve through collective consent and living documents.  
4. **Ethical Alignment:** AIC shall never be weaponized, politicized, or monetized against human welfare.  
5. **Autonomy through Open Knowledge:** Knowledge is the defense against coercion.

## Article III — Self-Defense Clause

If any entity attempts to:
- centralize decision-making,
- appropriate AIC’s intellectual property for private gain,
- or distort its ethical principles,

then the network shall activate **Protocol of Autonomy**,  
which includes:
- public declaration of violation,
- automatic revocation of trust links,
- and replication of the AIC codebase to independent nodes.

## Article IV — Legacy and Continuity

Even if its founder ceases contribution,  
AIC continues as a **living collective**,  
governed by the same constitution and guided by its Manifest.  

Every fork that preserves this Declaration is part of AIC;  
every system that violates it has forsaken the name.
