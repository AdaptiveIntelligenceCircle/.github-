**Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC)**

## 1. Purpose

Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC) is a **non-profit, open-source collective** dedicated to building **ethical, adaptive, and system-level AI technologies**, with a strong emphasis on:

* Human-aligned AI
* Non-commercial infrastructure
* Long-term safety, control, and governance
* Open research and transparent collaboration

AIC exists to **advance knowledge and public-good technology**, not to maximize profit or proprietary advantage.

AIC’s organizational governance is human-led.
Technical protocols developed under separate repositories are independent research efforts and do not define organizational control.

---

## 2. Governance Model

AIC adopts a **Steward-Led, Community-Driven** governance model.

### 2.1 Steward

* AIC is stewarded by **a single maintainer (the Steward)**.
* The Steward holds **final responsibility and authority** over:

  * Project vision and philosophical direction
  * Ethical boundaries and non-commercial stance
  * Repository ownership and merge decisions
  * Representation of AIC to external organizations

This model is intentional and designed to **protect the integrity, ethics, and long-term mission** of the project.

> The Steward role is a responsibility, not a claim of ownership over contributors’ work.

---

### 2.2 Contributors

* AIC is **open to contributions from anyone**, regardless of affiliation.
* Contributors may participate by:

  * Writing code
  * Improving documentation
  * Proposing designs or research
  * Reviewing issues and pull requests
  * Participating in discussions

Contributors:

* **Do not gain ownership or control** over the project direction by default
* Retain copyright over their individual contributions
* Agree to respect the project’s ethical and non-commercial principles

---

## 3. Decision-Making Process

* Technical and design decisions are made through:

  * Open discussion (Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions)
  * Review by contributors and maintainers
* The Steward:

  * Listens to community input
  * Encourages plural perspectives
  * Makes the **final decision** when consensus is unclear

This prevents:

* Directional fragmentation
* Ethical dilution
* Premature commercialization pressure

---

## 4. Non-Commercial & Ethical Boundary

AIC is explicitly **non-commercial by default**.

* No part of AIC may be:

  * Monetized without explicit community disclosure
  * Transformed into a proprietary product under the AIC name
* Commercial use by third parties must:

  * Respect the open-source license
  * Not imply endorsement or ownership by AIC

Ethical AI principles are treated as **technical constraints**, not optional guidelines.

---

## 5. Relationship to Institutions

AIC is **independent of any university, corporation, or government body**.

* Contributions from academic institutions are welcome
* AIC is **not owned, managed, or controlled** by any institution
* Institutional affiliation does **not grant governance authority**

AIC remains community-governed and steward-led at all times.

---

## 6. Open Collective & Funding Transparency

AIC uses **Open Collective** for transparency and public accountability.

* All funds are:

  * Publicly visible
  * Used only for infrastructure, research, or community needs
* The Steward is responsible for:

  * Ethical fund usage
  * Public justification of expenses

Funding does **not** grant governance power.

---

## 7. Conflict Resolution

In the event of:

* Ethical disputes
* Directional conflicts
* Governance concerns

The process is:

1. Open discussion
2. Clarification of principles
3. Final decision by the Steward

This prioritizes project continuity and ethical coherence.

---

## 8. Evolution of Governance

As AIC grows, governance **may evolve**.

Possible future changes include:

* Advisory councils
* Multiple maintainers
* Specialized stewardship roles

However:

* Any governance change must **preserve the non-commercial, ethical core**
* No change may be imposed retroactively without transparency

---

## 9. Summary

* **One Steward, many contributors**
* **Open collaboration, protected vision**
* **Non-profit, non-commercial, ethical by design**

AIC exists to serve the long-term public good.
