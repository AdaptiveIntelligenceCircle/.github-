# AIC Governance Protocol  
*(Adaptive, Transparent, and Trust-Based)*

**Version:** 1.0  

**Maintained by:** AIC Core Protocol Custodians  

**License:** Apache 2.0  

---

## I. Purpose

This document defines the **governance architecture** for AIC —  
a decentralized, self-regulating network designed to sustain open collaboration, ethical AI development, and adaptive consensus.

---

## II. Core Roles

| Role | Description | Duration |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Custodian** | Maintains core repository integrity; enforces governance updates. | 6 months (rotating) |
| **Contributor** | Develops, reviews, or documents modules within AIC. | Continuous |
| **Observer** | Participates in discussions, learns, and can propose issues. | Open |

Rotation is handled automatically through the script `ROTATE_ROLE.lua`,  
which computes trust and contribution scores to ensure fair leadership cycling.

## III. Governance Layers

1. **Root Charter**  
   - Defined in `DECLARATION_OF_AIC_AUTONOMY.md`.  
   - Immutable except by 90% community consensus.  

2. **Operational Layer**  
   - Defined in this `GOVERNANCE.md`.  
   - Controls versioning, voting, and conflict resolution.  

3. **Ethical Layer**  
   - Overseen by the Ethics Node.  
   - Verifies all commits and policies against human-aligned standards.  

---

## IV. Decision-Making

- **Consensus Threshold:**  
  `Proposal accepted if ≥70% active contributors approve via vote.`  

- **Voting Mechanism:**  
  Implemented via `VOTING_PROTOCOL.lua`, which verifies contribution hashes.  

- **Proposal Flow:**
   submit proposal → community discussion (7 days)
   → vote phase (3 days)
   → auto-merge if approved
  
- **Emergency Action:**  
Core maintainers may apply temporary patch only if  
(a) system security is threatened, and  
(b) patch expires in 72 hours without consensus renewal.

---

## V. Conflict & Fork Policy

- Any member may **fork AIC** freely.  
- A fork is recognized as **legitimate** if it:
- retains the `DECLARATION_OF_AIC_AUTONOMY.md` unchanged, and  
- remains open under Apache 2.0.  

Otherwise, the fork is classified as **Derivative Non-Compliant (DNC)**  
and cannot claim AIC lineage.

---

## VI. Ethics and Compliance

AIC rejects:
- state or corporate monopolization,  
- data exploitation,  
- AI militarization, and  
- manipulative behavioral systems.

Each module under `/modules/` must include a short ethics note:

## VII. Transparency and Records

- All commits are timestamped and signed by PGP or Git hash.  
---

## VIII. Sustainability and Evolution

- Governance is a *living protocol* — self-modifying under consensus.  
- Every 12 months, a **Meta Review** evaluates:
- fairness,
- participation,
- and resilience of the structure.

If the system stagnates, the review committee can trigger a **Governance Reset**, reinitializing the trust graph.

## IX. Closing Principle

> “In the absence of hierarchy, let truth and contribution be our order.”  
> — AIC Core Principle

- All governance votes and results are public in:
