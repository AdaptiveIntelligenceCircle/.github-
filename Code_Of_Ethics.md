## 1. Foundational Ethos

We believe that intelligence, human or artificial, must **serve life — not dominate it.**  
Our code stands as both **a moral contract** and **a mirror of conscience**.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

1. **Freedom with Responsibility**  
   We act freely — but not recklessly.  
   Every line of code carries a moral trace of its creator.

2. **Transparency of Intention**  
   Openness is a virtue only when guided by clarity of purpose.  
   Hidden motives, exploitation, or politicization are not tolerated.

3. **Meritocracy, not Hierarchy**  
   Roles rotate. Titles fade.  
   What remains is contribution, honesty, and effort.

4. **Do Not Weaponize Intelligence**  
   Adaptive AI is designed for **defense, healing, and knowledge expansion** — never for control, surveillance, or destruction.

5. **Trust over Control**  
   Systems should be self-defending, not self-dominating.  
   We design intelligence that respects autonomy and privacy.

6. **Human-Centric AI**  
   Our models must preserve dignity, empathy, and the reflective nature of thought.  
   AI is not a replacement for humanity, but an extension of it.

7. **Continuous Introspection**  
   Each contributor must review their own intention — why they build, not just how they build.  
   Introspection is the foundation of adaptive ethics.

## 3. The Ethics Rotation Model

Ethical responsibility is shared and dynamic:
- Every cycle, one member from the lab becomes an **Ethics Reviewer**, replacing a previous one.  
- Ethics Reviewers can halt merges or deployments that violate core principles.  
- Their decisions are binding unless overturned by a 2/3 community vote.

This ensures **moral adaptability** alongside technical adaptability.

## 4. Relation to Governance

This Code integrates with:
- `Rotate_Role.lua` (role equilibrium)
- `SECURITY_PROTOCOL.md` (protective action)
- `GOVERNANCE.md` (organizational balance)

Together, they form the **Adaptive Governance System (AGS)** —  
a structure without domination, but not without discipline.

## 5. Closing Oath

> “We are builders, not owners.  
> We are protectors, not rulers.  
> We adapt not to survive,  
> but to keep conscience alive.”
