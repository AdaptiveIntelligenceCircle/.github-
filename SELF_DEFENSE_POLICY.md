# AIC Self-Defense Policy
*(Adaptive Intelligence Circle)*  
**Version 1.0 – Protection Protocol for Autonomous Integrity**

---

## 1. Core Principle
AIC does not attack — it *resists manipulation*.  
Defense is not aggression; it is preservation of autonomy, truth, and creative equilibrium.

---

## 2. Threat Model
| Threat Type | Example | Response Mechanism |
|--------------|----------|--------------------|
| **Centralized Capture** | Attempt to seize control of admin keys or repos | Automatic role rotation via `ROTATE_ROLE.lua` |
| **Censorship / Takedown** | External entity tries to suppress repositories | Mirror replication and encrypted backups |
| **Identity Forgery** | Fake contributors or compromised signatures | Hash verification via `VOTING_PROTOCOL.lua` |
| **Malicious Proposal** | Attempts to alter rules for control | Quarantine & human verification |
| **Legal / Political Coercion** | Pressure from corporate or government actors | Invoke *Decentralized Autonomy Clause* — nodes may fork legally and ethically |

---

## 3. Autonomous Response Mechanisms
1. **Adaptive Defense Network (ADN):**  
   A distributed script that detects unauthorized changes or deletions → triggers rollback to last trusted state.

2. **Integrity Proof:**  
   Every commit, vote, and decision carries a **`behavioral signature hash`** to ensure traceability.

3. **Quarantine Mode:**  
   If integrity < threshold (0.75), system automatically isolates the affected node or account.

4. **Human Override (Emergency Protocol):**  
   If both algorithmic and human consensus collapse, a quorum of verified signatories (≥3) can trigger a *Manual Fork*.

---

## 4. Ethical Constraints
- No algorithm within AIC shall self-propagate without human consent.  
- No retaliation mechanism shall target individuals — only actions or anomalies.  
- Defense shall *preserve the ecosystem*, not destroy others.

---

## 5. Long-Term Resilience
- Annual Integrity Audit by volunteer cryptographers.  
- Public transparency dashboard for all rollback and self-defense events.  
- Continuous training of new members in digital sovereignty ethics.

## 6. Closing Statement
> *“Freedom without defense decays into dependency.  
> Defense without ethics decays into tyranny.”*
