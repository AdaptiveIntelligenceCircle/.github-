## 1. Purpose

This document defines the security principles and operational boundaries of the organization.  
It aims to maintain *trust, integrity, and resilience* across semi-open systems where contributors operate in a partially decentralized environment.

## 2. Core Security Principles

1. **Least Privilege Access**  
   Every member only has access to what they directly need.  
   Access escalation must be proposed, justified, and time-limited.

2. **Transparency with Controlled Disclosure**  
   - Open source modules are fully public.  
   - Critical modules (core kernel, security logic, adaptive reasoning) are restricted under NDA or encrypted sync.  
   - Internal discussions are logged but access-controlled.

3. **Code Integrity Validation**  
   All commits to `core/`, `protection/`, and `runtime/` must pass:
   - Hash validation (`validate_data_integrity.cpp`)
   - Signature check by at least two maintainers  
   - Behavior sandbox simulation before merge

4. **AI Safety Layer**  
   Adaptive models are never directly exposed to public input streams.  
   All external inference requests are filtered via:
   - Human-in-the-loop simulator  
   - Ethical context-checker  
   - Bayesian risk evaluator

5. **Incident & Rollback Protocol**  
   - Detection triggers → Log → Snapshot → Rollback  
   - The rollback is performed via `rollback_handler.cpp` or Lua sandbox routine  
   - All incidents are reviewed by the **Ethics & Security Rotation Group**

6. **Key Rotation & Credential Handling**  
   - Encryption keys are rotated every 90 days  
   - Contributors must use hardware-based or passphrase-based signing  
   - No secrets committed to public repos  

---

## 3. Governance Layer Integration

- Security policies are automatically enforced by `Rotate_Role.lua` via periodic audits.  
- The system performs random trust-checks and integrity sweeps.  
- Maintainers rotate every cycle to prevent centralized control.

## 4. Human-in-the-Loop Safety Board

> Every critical adaptive change must be reviewed by at least two members of different domains:
> - 1 from Technical (Core Dev)
> - 1 from Ethical Oversight (Behavior Analyst)

This ensures **both technical soundness and moral coherence**.

---

## 5. Emergency Override

In case of catastrophic AI malfunction or exploitation:
1. Lock external API endpoints.  
2. Trigger `system_freeze.lua` to sandbox all adaptive agents.  
3. Notify the core maintainers + ethics board.  
4. Perform full rollback and forensic review.

## 6. Closing Statement

Security in this organization is not about restriction —  
It’s about **preserving the integrity of creation** so that freedom can thrive responsibly.
